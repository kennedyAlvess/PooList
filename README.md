## Switching to the "dev" Branch

To switch to the "dev" branch, where the most up-to-date code is being developed, follow the steps below:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory of your local repository using the `cd` command.
3. Execute the command `git checkout dev`.

After executing these steps, you will be on the "dev" branch and can work with the most updated code in development.
